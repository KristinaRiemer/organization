## Review: Review/QA & Done tickets

## Review boards
- Cumulative Flow: Have many more tickets - documentation was added to board
- Control Chart: Removing documentation from chart & then it shows acceleration in work
- Burndown Chart: Looks good
- Velocity Tracking: Less than last sprint but above average for sprint 17 (current sprint)
