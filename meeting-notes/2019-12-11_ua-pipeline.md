2019-12-11

Present: Tony, Chris, Edwin, David, Eric, Julian

HackMD link: <https://hackmd.io/W9Fj7N5WQzy0AxZxTKQyoA>

Eric: (Nirav says:)

- Tar up files
- Directory structure
- icommands + remove Globus

Tony: Use `irsync` instead of `iput`

David: There is a currently a way to tar up files on NCSA before sending to tape.

Julian: Can we use this as a model for a local solution?

Eric: No Globus

Edwin: The manifest file generated by Globus might be a good place to hook in the IRODS & tar piece.

Eric: Could also do it just before the 'cleanup' step.

Eric: Getting trottled due to many small files, at registration (ireg) as well as download steps.

Chris: What about the metadata for the single files? For discovery, etc. Never mind, that's a workflow issue.

(Discussion of road map)

David: Why such a strong anti-Globus sentiment?

Eric: Replication of infrastructure, maintaining two different, parallel systems.

Julian: (Do not move everything at the same time, reliability, etc. Reliable operation depends on Globus & various scripts.)

Eric: Agreed. (:thumbsup: in front of proposed roadmap.)
