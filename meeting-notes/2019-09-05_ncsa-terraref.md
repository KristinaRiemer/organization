## Current status of Globus?

J: Last known, Edwin had set it up and ready to use, then we talked to Nirav (halted), and we still have to run benchmarks.

D: Tested some Globus transfer, and worked for bit, then didn't. Endpoint is down.

T: Maintenance last week, rebooted servers, so Globus software might not have come back up afterwards.

D: Also found out that GDrive @ UA has unlimited storage, and might store TERRA-REF data there long term. Can IRODS integrate with GDrive?

T: Next year CyVerse Data Store will be able to use any S3 compatible service (like GDrive) as a backing store.


## Status standing up pipeline

J: Need to test with larger data, that will take a day or more to process.

Postponed in favor of Makeflow PoC and BETYdb on Nomad this sprint.

Made progress on BETYdb on Nomad, another few hours remaining.

Will catch up with Sateesh about combining efforts on Makeflow PoC.
