## Notes

Started: 14:02
Finished: 14:32


## TODO

- [ ] Issues for David to review: Make #104 into an epic, and add the rest of the issues into the epic (David)
- [ ] Create issue for Sprint 20 (3rd from the top) to read gantry handover doc and make notes about things to clarify, possibly meeting/Slacking with Sean (Julian)
- [ ] Create epics for team-level Key Results (Chris)
    - There will be issues in these epics. Each issue will be assigned to one or more individuals. A completed issue will bring us closer to achieving one of the team's key results.
    - Consider using ZenHub releases to keep track of objectives and/or key results. See: [Common questions when getting started with Release](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000481740-common-questions-when-getting-started-with-releases)
    - May need to reword Objectives & Key Results. See [OKR best practices](https://github.com/az-digitalag/organization/issues/47#issuecomment-519671978).
